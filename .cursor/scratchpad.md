# Project Planning Document - Comprehensive Design System Implementation

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to redesign the entire Web3 security audit platform according to the design.json styling system. This involves implementing a cohesive sci-fi dark theme across all components, pages, and user interfaces.

**Design System Overview:**
- **Theme**: Sci-fi dark modern with neon accents
- **Colors**: Dark backgrounds (#131822, #181f2f) with purple (#a879ef) and cyan (#32d9fa) accents
- **Typography**: Space Grotesk primary, IBM Plex Mono for code/data
- **Effects**: Glassmorphism, glowing elements, gradient buttons
- **Components**: Modern rounded corners, consistent spacing, accessibility-focused

**Scope**: Complete platform redesign including all components, pages, and styling systems.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

## Lessons

- **CSS Variables Strategy**: Using CSS variables instead of HSL functions provides better compatibility and performance
- **Design Token Organization**: Grouping variables by category (colors, typography, spacing) makes maintenance easier
- **Tailwind Integration**: Mapping design tokens to both native CSS classes and Tailwind utilities provides flexibility
