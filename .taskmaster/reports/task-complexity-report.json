			"taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the comprehensive test suite implementation into specific subtasks for each test category (unit, integration, E2E, performance, security), including setup, implementation, documentation, and CI integration for each.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple test types requiring different frameworks and expertise. Involves unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security testing, each with its own implementation details and technical requirements."

			"taskTitle": "Set Up Automated Testing Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for each component of the automated testing infrastructure: CI/CD pipeline configuration, test reporting setup, performance monitoring integration, error tracking integration, automation script development, and alert configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Involves multiple systems integration (CI/CD, reporting, monitoring, error tracking) and requires DevOps expertise. Each component has its own technical challenges and dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Enhanced Error Boundary",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the error boundary implementation into subtasks covering component creation, error reporting integration, styling of error pages, and testing across different scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it involves React error handling patterns and integration with error reporting services. The code example provides a starting point, but implementation across the application and proper error reporting requires careful planning."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for error tracking service integration, structured logging implementation, log aggregation setup, dashboard creation, and alert configuration, with each addressing specific technical requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Involves multiple systems (Sentry, Winston, ELK) and requires careful configuration for proper error tracking and logging. Privacy considerations and proper sampling add additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Retry Mechanisms for API Calls",
