# Deployment Plan - June 2025 Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the incremental deployment strategy for the June 2025 platform updates, focusing on navigation improvements and error handling enhancements.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing (navigation, error handling, search functionality)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks reviewed
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Backup procedures verified
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

## Phase 1: Error Handling (Day 1)
1. Deploy enhanced error boundary
2. Monitor error tracking system
3. Verify logging functionality
4. Test retry mechanisms
5. Rollback trigger: >1% increase in unhandled errors

## Phase 2: Navigation Structure (Day 2-3)
1. Deploy updated navigation links
2. Enable new sections (AI Suite, Cross-Chain)
3. Update footer content
4. Monitor 404 errors
5. Rollback trigger: >5% increase in navigation errors

## Phase 3: Search Improvements (Day 4)
1. Deploy enhanced search functionality
2. Enable keyboard navigation
3. Update search indices
4. Monitor search performance
5. Rollback trigger: >500ms average search time

## Phase 4: Final Integration (Day 5)
1. Enable all new features
2. Remove deprecated routes
3. Update documentation
4. Monitor system performance
5. Rollback trigger: Any critical user-facing issues

## Monitoring Metrics
- Error rates
- Navigation success rate
- Search response time
- Server load
- User engagement
- Support ticket volume

## Rollback Procedures
1. Immediate rollback triggers:
   - Critical security issues
   - Data integrity problems
   - System-wide performance degradation

2. Gradual rollback triggers:
   - Increased error rates
   - Poor user feedback
   - Performance degradation

3. Rollback steps:
   ```bash
   # Quick rollback command
   npm run deploy:rollback

   # Specific version rollback
   npm run deploy:rollback -- --version=2.4.0
   ```

## Communication Plan
1. Pre-deployment:
   - User notification (48h advance)
   - Team briefing
   - Support team training

2. During deployment:
   - Status page updates
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Support team standby

3. Post-deployment:
   - Success metrics review
   - User feedback collection
   - Documentation updates

## Support Procedures
1. Dedicated support team during rollout
2. Enhanced monitoring for first 72 hours
3. Quick response procedures for critical issues
4. User feedback collection and analysis

## Success Criteria
- Error rate reduction: 20%
- Navigation success rate: >99%
- Search response time: <200ms
- User satisfaction: >90%
- Zero critical security issues
