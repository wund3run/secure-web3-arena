# Error Handling System PRD

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan for a comprehensive error handling system across the platform.

## Goals
- Unify error handling across the application
- Improve user experience during error scenarios
- Ensure proper error tracking and monitoring
- Implement robust recovery mechanisms
- Reduce duplicate code and complexity

## Requirements

### 1. Error Boundaries
- Single, unified error boundary implementation
- Consistent error UI across the application
- Support for component-level and route-level error handling
- Automatic error reporting to monitoring service
- Retry mechanisms for recoverable errors

### 2. API Error Handling
- Standardized error response format
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Error categorization and appropriate responses
- Integration with monitoring service
- Support for offline scenarios

### 3. Error Monitoring
- Batched error reporting
- Environment-aware logging
- Error deduplication
- Critical error alerting
- Error analytics and trends

### 4. User Experience
- Clear error messages
- Recovery options where applicable
- Consistent error UI components
- Offline support
- Progressive enhancement

### 5. Developer Experience
- Simplified error handling hooks
- Type-safe error utilities
- Testing utilities
- Documentation
- Migration guide

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Implement unified error boundary
2. Create enhanced API error handler
3. Set up monitoring service
4. Develop core UI components

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Replace existing error boundaries
2. Migrate API calls to new error handler
3. Integrate monitoring service
4. Update error UI components

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. Add retry mechanisms
2. Implement offline support
3. Add error analytics
4. Enhance monitoring capabilities

### Phase 4: Documentation & Testing
1. Write comprehensive tests
2. Create documentation
3. Provide migration guides
4. Performance testing

## Success Metrics
- Reduced error rates
- Improved error recovery rates
- Decreased duplicate error reports
- Increased user satisfaction
- Reduced development time for error handling

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 1 week
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 1 week

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: Breaking existing error handling
  Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout

- Risk: Performance impact
  Mitigation: Implement batching and throttling

- Risk: Missing error scenarios
  Mitigation: Extensive testing and monitoring

## Dependencies
- React 18+
- TypeScript 4.5+
- Monitoring service integration
- UI component library
