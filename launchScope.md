## 1. Core Platform Architecture & Backend
- **Platform Orchestration:**
  - Ensure all services are registered and health checks are passing (`src/services/platformOrchestration.ts`).
  - Review event publishing, cross-service communication, and system health reporting.
  - Run integration health checks and optimize resources (caching, performance, security recommendations).
- **Supabase Functions:**
  - Review and test all serverless functions in `supabase/functions/` (ai-code-analysis, create-escrow, create-payment-intent, send-email).
  - Validate environment variables and secrets in `supabase/config.toml`.
- **Database:**
  - Apply and verify latest migration (`supabase/migrations/20250601000001_create_audit_tables.sql`).
  - Test data integrity and rollback procedures.

## 2. Security, Authentication, and Access Control
- **Authentication:**
  - Test all login, registration, and 2FA flows (`src/pages/EnhancedAuth.tsx`, `TwoFactorAuth.tsx`, `SecuritySettings.tsx`).
  - Enforce MFA for all users; verify backup codes and recovery.
- **RBAC & Route Access:**
  - Audit all route and action permissions (`src/utils/auth/roleBasedRouting.ts`, `roleAccess.ts`).
  - Test role-based content and admin/auditor/project-owner separation.
- **Session Management:**
  - Validate session expiration, device tracking, and concurrent session limits.
- **Security Headers & Monitoring:**
  - Confirm all security headers are set (`SecurityHeadersManager.ts`).
  - Test audit logging, security event listeners, and incident reporting (`SecurityInitializer.ts`, `AuditLogger.ts`).
- **Vulnerability Scanning:**
  - Run automated and manual scans on all endpoints and smart contracts.
- **Compliance:**
  - Review privacy, terms, and security policy pages for completeness.

## 3. Error Handling, Monitoring, and Logging
- **Error Boundaries:**
  - Ensure all route-level components are wrapped with `UnifiedErrorBoundary`.
- **API Error Handling:**
  - Use `withErrorHandling` for all API/network calls; test retry and offline support.
- **Monitoring Service:**
  - Validate error reporting, alert thresholds, and analytics (`monitoringService.ts`).
  - Test error escalation and incident response triggers.
- **User Feedback:**
  - Confirm user-facing error messages, toasts, and support links are clear and actionable.

## 4. CI/CD, Deployment, and Environment
- **Scripts:**
  - Review and test all scripts in `/scripts` (run-tests.sh, test-deployment.sh, security-audit.sh, fix-critical-errors.js).
- **Serverless Functions:**
  - Deploy and test all Supabase functions.
- **Kubernetes/Cloud Config:**
  - Review generated configs (`EnterpriseService.generateKubernetesConfig`).
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Audit all secrets and environment variables for production safety.
- **Smoke Test:**
  - Run end-to-end smoke test after deployment.

## 5. Database & Data Integrity
- **Migrations:**
  - Apply and verify all migrations.
- **Backups:**
  - Ensure backup/restore procedures are documented and tested.
- **Data Validation:**
  - Run data integrity checks on all critical tables.
