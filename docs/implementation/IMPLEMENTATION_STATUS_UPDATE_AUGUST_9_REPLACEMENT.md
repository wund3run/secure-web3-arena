# Implementation Status Update - ProjectDashboard.tsx Replacement

Date: August 9, 2023

## Technical Challenge

Due to technical limitations with the file replacement process, I recommend we:

1. Create a new file named `ProjectDashboard.new.tsx`
2. Implement all changes in the new file
3. Once verified, use the terminal to rename files

This will ensure a clean implementation without risking the current file's integrity.

## Implementation Strategy

The new implementation will include:
- All Hawkly UI components
- Enhanced project statistics
- Improved card layouts
- New filtering and sorting system

## Next Steps

Would you like me to proceed with creating `ProjectDashboard.new.tsx` with the complete implementation?

## Implementation Details

The new version will include:
1. Proper usage of HawklyCard variants
2. Custom color palette from the design system
3. Enhanced metric displays with LiveMetric component
4. Security badge integration
5. Improved progress indicators with glow effects

Please confirm if you'd like me to proceed with this approach.
