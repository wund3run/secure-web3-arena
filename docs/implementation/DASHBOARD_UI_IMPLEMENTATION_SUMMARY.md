## Next Steps

1. **Review Implementation**
   - Validate the design against requirements
   - Check for any missing components or functionality
   - Ensure responsive behavior works as expected

2. **Component Development**
   - Create or update any missing UI components
   - Implement the `hawkly-components.ts` file with all required components
   - Develop placeholder components for role-specific dashboard content

3. **Testing**
   - Test responsive behavior across device sizes
   - Validate tab navigation functionality
   - Ensure role-based content appears correctly
   - Verify sidebar collapse/expand functionality

4. **Implementation**
   - Replace the current Dashboard.tsx with the new implementation
   - Update any dependent components as needed
   - Document any additional changes required
