   - Used highlighted variant for CTA section
   - Applied appropriate elevation and glow effects

2. **SecurityBadge**

3. **Styling Updates**
   - Implemented blue-to-cyan gradient theme (differentiating from SecurityAudits.tsx purple-to-blue)
   - Applied consistent dark background with glass effects
   - Updated typography with gradient text headers

## Notable Changes

1. **Hero Section**

   - Implemented numbered steps with gradient styling
   - Enhanced visual hierarchy with consistent spacing

4. **CTA Section**
   - Created highlighted HawklyCard with strong elevation
   - Added subtle background patterns for depth
   - Enhanced button with gradient styling

## Testing Status

- ✅ Desktop layout verified at 1920px and 1440px
- ⚠️ Mobile layout needs additional testing
- ⚠️ Animation performance needs verification on lower-end devices

## Known Issues

1. **Grid Pattern Background**: The background pattern reference may need to be updated if the asset doesn't exist
2. **Mobile Layout**: Some adjustments may be needed for optimal mobile experience, particularly in the process section
3. **Image Assets**: No fallback handling for missing image assets

## Next Steps

1. Complete mobile responsiveness testing
2. Verify all links work correctly
3. Test animation performance on various devices
4. Review with design team for final approval

## Metrics Update

- Service pages completion increased from 25% to 33%
- Overall implementation progress increased to 15% (from 13%)

This implementation follows the design patterns established in SecurityAudits.tsx but uses a different color palette to differentiate the service offering while maintaining the cohesive Hawkly design language.
