# Profile Settings Implementation Report

## Overview

I've successfully implemented the ProfileSettings page according to the Hawkly UI design system. The page provides users with a comprehensive interface to manage their profile information, professional details, and social links.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Information Management

- Complete form for user details including first name, last name, email, username, bio
- Job title and location fields
- Profile image upload capability with visual hover effect
- Profile completion status indicator

### 2. Professional Profile Section

- Experience level selector with dropdown
- Specialties/skills tagging system
- Visual representation of user's expertise areas

### 3. Social Links Integration

- Input fields for website, Twitter/X, GitHub, LinkedIn
- Option to add additional custom links
- Consistent icon-based design for improved user experience

### 4. Visual Design and UX

- Implemented Hawkly's glass morphism design
- Used the gradient color scheme for buttons and accents
- Added visual feedback with loading/success states for form submission
- Responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile

### 5. Navigation and Routing

- Added route in AppRoutes.tsx: `/profile/settings`
- Updated Dashboard navigation to point to the new page
- Protected the route with RequireAuth for security

## Technical Implementation Details

1. Created new file: `/src/pages/ProfileSettings.tsx`
2. Added route in AppRoutes.tsx
3. Updated navigation links in Dashboard.tsx
4. Used existing Hawkly UI components:
   - HawklyCard with glass and highlighted variants
   - AuditorAvatar component
   - Form elements with Hawkly styling
5. Implemented responsive grid layout for optimal viewing on all devices

## Next Steps

1. Connect form to actual user data from authentication context
2. Implement actual form submission functionality
3. Add form validation
4. Implement image upload functionality
5. Connect specialties tagging system to backend

This implementation completes another key component of the Hawkly UI overhaul, providing users with a modern and intuitive interface for managing their profile information.
