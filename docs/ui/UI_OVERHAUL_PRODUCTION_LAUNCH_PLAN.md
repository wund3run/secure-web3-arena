   - Daily sync to ensure consistency across implementations

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with core functionality using new components
   - Add animations and advanced features after basic implementation

4. **Testing Protocol**
   - Unit test each page upon completion
   - Visual regression testing against designs
   - Cross-browser compatibility checks

### Resource Allocation
