## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **JSX Navigation Warnings**

**Problem**: Components were using `<a href="">` tags and `window.location.href` which cause full page reloads instead of React Router navigation.

**Fixed in PersonalizedWelcome.tsx**:
- ✅ Replaced `<a href={feature.link}>` with `<Link to={feature.link}>`
- ✅ Replaced `<a href={step.link}>` with `<Link to={step.link}>`
- ✅ Added proper React Router `Link` import

**Fixed in PersonalizedQuickActions.tsx**:
- ✅ Replaced `window.location.href = '/service-provider-onboarding'` with `navigate('/service-provider-onboarding')`
- ✅ Replaced all `window.location.href` calls with `navigate()` function
- ✅ Moved QUICK_ACTIONS array inside component to access `useNavigate` hook
- ✅ Added proper React Router `useNavigate` import

### 2. **Accessibility Improvements**

**Added ARIA Labels and Semantic HTML**:

✅ **PersonalizedWelcome.tsx**:
- Added `role="main"` and `aria-label="Personalized auditor dashboard"` to main container
- Added `role="banner"` and `aria-label="Daily motivation"` to motivational quote
- Added `role="progressbar"` with proper `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax` to progress bar
- Added `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` to feature recommendations
- Added `aria-label` attributes to badges and buttons with descriptive text
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons
- Enhanced button labels with context: `aria-label="${feature.ctaText} - ${feature.title}"`

✅ **PersonalizedQuickActions.tsx**:
- Added `role="region"` and `aria-label="Personalized quick actions"` to main container
- Added `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` to action cards
- Added descriptive `aria-label` attributes to all interactive elements
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons
- Enhanced button accessibility with status-aware labels

### 3. **Component Structure Cleanup**

**PersonalizedQuickActions.tsx**:
- ✅ Restructured QUICK_ACTIONS to be defined inside the component
- ✅ Updated icon references to use component imports instead of JSX elements
- ✅ Fixed navigation flow to use React Router instead of browser navigation
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality while improving performance

## 📋 Technical Implementation Details

### Navigation Flow Improvements

**Before**:
```javascript
// Caused full page reloads
action: () => window.location.href = '/service-provider-onboarding'
<a href={feature.link}>Button Text</a>
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Uses React Router navigation
action: () => navigate('/service-provider-onboarding')
<Link to={feature.link} aria-label="Button Text - Feature Title">
  Button Text
</Link>
```

### Accessibility Enhancements

**Progress Bar**:
```jsx
<div 
  role="progressbar" 
  aria-valuenow={personalizedContent.onboardingProgress} 
  aria-valuemin={0} 
  aria-valuemax={100} 
  aria-label="Profile completion progress"
>
  <Progress value={personalizedContent.onboardingProgress} />
</div>
```

**Action Cards**:
```jsx
<Card role="listitem">
  <Button 
    aria-label={action.completed ? 
      `${action.title} - Completed` : 
      `${action.ctaText} - ${action.title}`
    }
  >
    {action.ctaText}
  </Button>
</Card>
```
