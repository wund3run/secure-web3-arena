## Developer Notes

1. When implementing new pages:
   - Import HawklyCard, SecurityBadge and other components at the top
   - Use consistent color palette (purple, blue, cyan gradients)
   - Implement glass morphism effects for cards
   - Add glow effects to important elements
   - Use consistent text colors (white for headings, gray-300/400 for body text)

2. Component reuse patterns:
   - Use ProgressIndicator for numerical stats
   - Use SecurityBadge for verification indicators
   - Apply consistent button styling with gradients

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Auth.tsx according to launch plan timeline
2. Complete remaining high-priority pages by August 10th
3. Conduct team training session on Hawkly component usage
