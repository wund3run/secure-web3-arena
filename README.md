# Secure Web3 Arena

A comprehensive security audit platform for Web3 projects, built with React, TypeScript, and modern tooling.

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 8 or higher
- Access to production environment variables

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.production` to `.env.local` and fill in the required values:
```bash
cp .env.production .env.local
```

2. Configure the following environment variables:
- `VITE_APP_URL`: Production application URL
- `VITE_API_URL`: Production API endpoint
- `VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN`: Authentication domain
- `VITE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`: Authentication client ID
- `VITE_AUTH_AUDIENCE`: Authentication audience
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`: Sentry DSN for error tracking
- `VITE_GA_TRACKING_ID`: Google Analytics tracking ID

### Build and Deploy

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm ci
```

2. Run type checks:
```bash
npm run type-check
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

5. The build output will be in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

### CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployments:
- Pushes to `main` trigger automatic deployments
- Each deployment runs type checks, tests, and builds
- Production builds are deployed to Cloudflare Pages

### Security Considerations

1. Content Security Policy (CSP) is enabled by default
2. All API endpoints use HTTPS
3. Authentication tokens are handled securely
4. File uploads are limited to 5MB
5. Regular security audits are performed

### Monitoring

- Error tracking via Sentry
- Performance monitoring via Google Analytics
- Server-side logs via CloudWatch
